# Information-Loss-in-Gaussian-Spectral-Data

This repository contains a summary of a Python method to determine the loss of information from dimensionality reduction in Gaussian-distributed 
spectral data, as described in 2301.11923.pdf. 

In order to estimate the relative loss of information, the 5D Shannon Entropy from Gaussian-distributed spectral data is calculated in this primary study (@hema.to GmbH) on information loss from dimensionality reduction as a quantitative measure in order to calculate and compare the deviations of the total 
entropy to the sum of entropies in an ensemble of particles emitting five different frequency components.  

If you are interested in the Python source code of the corresponding Gaussian information model, please contact :

    Dr. A. Schelle, Freelancer Lecturer @ IU International University of Applied Sciences (E-Mail: alexej.schelle.ext@iu.org), or        
    Dr. Hannes LÃ¼ling, CEO @ hema.to GmbH, Ainmiller Str. 22, 80801 Munich (E-Mail: hannes@hema.to).

Currently, I am also interested in extending the presented analysis to the general case of randomly distributed spectral FCS data at finite temperature in arbitrary dimensions from N = 2 to N = 10. For collaborations and scholary projects, please simply contact me at alexej.schelle.ext@iu.org.

With best regards,

Alexej.
